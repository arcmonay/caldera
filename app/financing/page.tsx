        High-ticket wellness equipment is often purchased on a payment plan so a room can open before the cash account is empty. Caldera works with third-party lenders. Approval, rates, and terms are theirs — not ours.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          Choose a machine or package, then apply with the lender linked at checkout or through a specialist. Monthly figures on product pages are illustrations at 36 months, not an offer.
        </p>
        <h2>What we will not say</h2>
        <p>
          We do not advertise approval rates, guaranteed financing, or named providers until those partnerships are live. Credit decisions belong to the lender. If a plan is declined, you can still request a quote and pay by invoice.
        </p>
        <h2>Facility accounts</h2>
